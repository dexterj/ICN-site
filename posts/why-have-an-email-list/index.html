      <h1>Why should you build an email list?</h1>
<p>So you've made comics. Why would you possibly need an email list? Well, to be honest, if you're done making comics and you don't want to sell anymore then you don't need an email list. So... goodbye.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Oh, are you still here?</p>
<p>So, you're not done making comics? Oh, okay. <strong>Well then, you need a list.</strong></p>
<p>Why? You might ask. Well, do you plan to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sell more comics?</li>
<li>Have a Kickstarter or IndieGoGo?</li>
<li>Go to conventions?</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these things are fun alone but they're better <strong>when your audience knows about them</strong>. You can't sell comics <strong>if your fans don't know you have a new one</strong>, you can't crowd fund your comic <strong>if your fans don't know about it</strong> and you can always make new friends at a con, but it's always good to re-engage your audience if you can.</p>
<p>Why engage? Because, it reminds your fans that you exist and that you're still doing things that they like. It's the reason why big brands advertise at all. It's why Pepsi advertises so much. You're not going to forget it's there when you want a pop, but you're more likely to look for it instead of a Coke if you're thinking of the ad you saw fifty times last week.</p>
<p>So, yes, you need an email list for sending news to your fans. Do it now! Go to and email service provider (ESP) like MailChimp and start one.</p>
<h2>So, okay you got an account... but how to I fill it?</h2>
<p>This is the fun part (at least for me).</p>
<p>If you've done a some crowd funding in the past, you probably actually already have a list.</p>
<p>You can also use the forms provided by the ESP (either embed it on your website or link to it on theirs). Something I would recommend is making a QR code that links to the form and displaying it on your table at cons... like next to your business cards. That way folks can just scan it and sign up. Beats them taking a card and throwing it away later.</p>
<p>You could also do a giveaway for email signups. Especially at a con and especially if you're an illustrator. At the end of the con email a rando on the list and send them a drawing. Consider asking folks as they walk by to comment on a tweet or Instagram post regarding what you should draw (thank [Russell Nohelty (https://twitter.com/russellnohelty) &quot;Russell Nohelty's Twitter&quot;] for this one), then at a designated time, draw it during a live video on FB/Insta and give that drawing away. This way you:</p>
<ol>
<li>People are talking about you on social (mmm...attention...)</li>
<li>get buzz around your table (hey that person's giving away a free drawing)</li>
<li>get the drawing to giveaway done at the con and it's one less thing to do later (sleep later)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Okay, so you have a list now... now what?</h2>
<p>Email people, duh. But not too much... or too little. Make sure it's entertaining...</p>
<p>So, Monthly is a good place to start. Test more or less to see if you get better responses. But pretty much be sending when you have something to say.</p>
<ol>
<li>If it's convention season, send out monthly updates listing what con's you'll be going to.</li>
<li>If you have a new project coming out make sure they know when and where it'll debut.</li>
<li>If it's crowd funding related tell them early and often.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What's the best size?</h3>
<p>It doesn't matter... maybe. Again, test it out. Generally speaking though:</p>
<ol>
<li>Short like one or two paragraphs.</li>
<li>Have a nice image that belongs there.</li>
<li>Link to a longer post if you need to.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make it bigger, make it shorter. See what people respond to. But generally folks get bored easy and if your bore them before your big message or reveal, they'll leave. So, keeping it short and to the point is a good place to start.</p>
<h2>Legal stuff</h2>
<p>Depending on where you live laws around email differ. But they are generally the same in regards to:</p>
<ol>
<li>DO NOT EMAIL ANYONE WHO DIDN'T ASK YOU TO EMAIL THEM. Especially when it comes to marketing. You can get away with a little marketing when sending a receipt (but a purchase is not consent to be put on an email list). So if you sell things with an email receipt, you should look into trying to get people to sign up for your email list as part of the receipt.</li>
<li>DELETE EMAILS FROM YOUR LIST IF THEY'RE NOT INTERACTING WITH YOU. A clean email list is a good email list. You don't want people there if they're not opening and reading your email. If you have a massive list and most of the people on there aren't reading it, places like Gmail will start to put the email in the junk folder. So, make sure you go through and remove people who haven't opened your email... maybe quarterly... maybe more. If this makes you nervous or sad, maybe send an email to just the people who haven't opened an email and ask them if they still want to be there... maybe offer something like a free comic, idk. But, this way they're at least engaging again and you know they want to be there. Then a month later delete the folks who didn't respond.</li>
</ol>
